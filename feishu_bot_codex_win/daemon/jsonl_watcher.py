"""Async wrapper that yields a signal whenever the watched jsonl file grows.

Uses watchfiles (fsevents/inotify) as the primary low-latency notifier, with
a 2-second size-polling fallback. The polling fallback is critical for Codex,
which appends to jsonl in a way that doesn't reliably trigger fsevents on
macOS — without it, the outbound mirror would stall indefinitely until
something else touched the file.
